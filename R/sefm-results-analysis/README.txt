The folders contain information on the cross-correlation and autocorrelation of the residuals of the SEFM models. There are three ways a SEFM models could be estimated; we annotate each country with its mode of estimation.

1) NLS-1. This is the nonlinear least squares estimation, including cointegration relationships.
2) NLS-2. This is the nonlinear least squares estimation, excluding cointegration relationships. Applicable if no cointegration relationship was found.
3) OLS. Classical ordinary least squares estimation. Applicable if the NLS models did not converge in 500 iterations.
